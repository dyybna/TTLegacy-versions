## 依旧是我 : 禁闭

_TT "我是禁闭"! :wave:_

*You should all be here for the old TT version I'm telling you the bad news that the old version is dead:

- TT  I'm telling you the bad news that the old version is dead
- TT If you have anything to say, you can send me a private message in the background

*Warning: The old version is dead.


To get you started, we ran an Actions workflow in your new repository that, among other things, created a branch for you to work in, called `welcome-workflow`.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a workflow file

1. Open a new browser tab, and navigate to this same repository. Then, work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. Create a pull request. This will contain all of the changes you'll make throughout this part of the course.

   Click the **Pull Requests** tab, click **New pull request**, set `base: main` and `compare:welcome-workflow`, click **Create pull request**, then click **Create pull request** again.

1. Navigate to the **Code** tab.
1. From the **main** branch dropdown, click on the **welcome-workflow** branch.
1. Navigate to the `.github/workflows/` folder, then select **Add file** and click on **Create new file**.
1. In the **Name your file** field, enter `welcome.yml`.
1. Add the following content to the `welcome.yml` file:

   ```yaml copy
   name: Post welcome comment
   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [opened]
   permissions:
     pull-requests: write
   ```

1. To commit your changes, click **Commit changes**.
1. Type a commit message, select **Commit directly to the welcome-workflow branch** and click **Commit changes**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). A separate Actions workflow in the repository (not the workflow you created) will run and will automatically replace the contents of this README file with instructions for the next step.
